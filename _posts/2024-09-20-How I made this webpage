I knew nothing about computer programming.  I set out on a journey to build a personal webpage at nights and on weekends. I climbed what felt like a mountain, catching some breathtaking views en route, but also twisting my ankle along the way and even going back down to base camp and starting again.   

First, I packed my climbing pack with 'why' I was doing this.  I wanted a platform to share what I see, and design it to my style.  I also didn't want to pay annual fees for a website hosting service like Squarespace or Wix because my finance tax brain knew that the expense is not deductible because it's not "on account of income" (I currently have no intention of earning income from this).  Throughout my journey, when it got frustrating, I had to reach into my pack to remind myself why I was doing this.

Before I set off on my journey, I figured I should learn some basics.  I took out one of my prized possessions, my Toronto Public Library card, and I set off to the library to borrow a textbook, [Learn Enough HTML, CSS and Layout to be Dangerous](https://www.amazon.ca/Learn-Enough-HTML-Layout-Dangerous/dp/0137843100), to teach myself the basics of **HTML and CSS**.  The textbook provided helpful higher level background and context.  After learning the basics from the first few chapters, I left the textbook and took to **ChatGPT, Youtube, and other webpages** to get solutions to specific problems. 

I spent a lot of time circling the base of the mountain before starting the climb.  I downloaded **VS Code** so that I could customize my webpage and write content.  I learned how to import images, add links to webpages, customize and format the layout and colours, and add pages behind the index page.  

I stumbled over tree roots on the journey up, twisting my ankle several times along the way.  I downloaded **Github**, a free static site hosting that takes HTML and CSS that nobody can see from a folder on Github and publishes it online.  The new terminology was confusing to me (what is a "repository"?).  I also stumbled over re-directing a domain (adriennefong.net) to Github that I had previously bought.  But finally, the sunshine broke through the clouds - I managed to publish a few amateur looking pages online.
 
But midway up the mountain, I encountered a major setback when I realized that adding multiple pages behind the index page was going to be frustrating.  I make a tough call to go back down the mountain and start again.  I turned to **Jekyll**, a static site generator.  I fumbled through the installation process.  I watched **Youtube videos**, [Up and Running with Github Pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvYs1idcGnM&list=PLWzwUIYZpnJuT0sH4BN56P5oWTdHJiTNq&index=4), multiple times.   I'm only now starting to learn to customize the template theme to my liking.  

I haven't reached the mountain peak.  Learning hard things feels hard.  I have many improvements I'd like to make.  While it's important to keep climbing, I also remind myself to stop and look back and see how far I've come and appreciate how much I've learned.
