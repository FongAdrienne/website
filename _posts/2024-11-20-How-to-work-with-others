### *“If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together”* ~ African proverb

It is rare to build something great alone.  But working with others has its challenges.  Over the last twenty plus years, I have worked on many teams and most recently with advisors in different countries.  Is it possible to have a team that has good relations with each other (conflicts avoided), collaborates seamlessly (everyone understands the goals and intent of the message), prevents mistakes or wasting time that come from misunderstanding the message?

In the book, the [Culture Map (how people think, lead, and get things done) by Erin Meyer](https://www.amazon.ca/Culture-Map-Breaking-Invisible-Boundaries/dp/1610392507), the author described a critical skill to working with others. **"Reading the Air"**, the ability to read between the lines, the ability to understand true meaning behind words that say something utterly different, was fascinating.  There is so much implicit communication that underlies the words exchanged, some of it driven by language, history, and cultural norms.  

To North Americans, good communication is clear, simple, and straight to the point.  We say what we mean.  It is good practice to  summarize key points and conclude at the end of meetings.  In contrast, in countries such as Japan, Korea, and Indonesia, good communication is not clear, simple and straight to the point.  Rather, it is layered, nuanced, and sophisticated.  There is much reading between the lines, and the point of the message is often implied.  It can be offensive to others to repeat and summarize, insinuating that they are slow to understand.  I learned that it is important to identify who I am speaking to, to understand and adapt to their way of communicating, and to listen very closely to what they are truly saying.

Learning to work well with others requires strong communication skills.  I learned that it requires wanting to and caring to understand others and a willingness to adapt my way of communicating to others.  Skilled communication is necessary in project management, people management, and leadership and learning to do it well can be a great advantage.
