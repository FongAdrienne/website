### *"People can change their own lives....They're not asking for charity, charity is no solution to poverty"* ~ Dr. Muhammad Yunus 

Earlier this month, Dr. Muhammad Yunus was installed to head an interim government in Bangladesh, to try to restore peace and steady the ship during a tumultuous time.  I remembered reading about him as a teenager, when he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his and Grameen Bank's work in providing small loans to the poor, mostly women, to help them start businesses and eventually lift themselves out of poverty.  

Unlike mainstream banks, Grameen Bank didn't make poor customers put up assets as collateral they didn't have before extending loans to them, opening up an entire market that had never previously had access to a loan.  The idea seems crazy - what if the customer runs off with the money?  Can you trust people to repay the loan?  I work in the retail lending industry and there are entire operations within banks and lenders tasked to figure out if someone is safe to lend money and defining acceptable collateral levels. According to Grameen Bank's website (https://grameenbank.org.bd/about/introduction), they have a 96.29% recovery rate (as of June 2024), proving that it does work.   The reasons why it works is not clear to me, and the answer is probably that it is complex. Perhaps they benefitted from some training and direct assistance to help their businesses succeed and perhaps some social pressure from the community that incentivizes them not to flee.

Grameen Bank created opportunities. They provided start up capital to women to start businesses.  In an interview with Dr. Yunus, he observed, "people can change their own lives, provided they have the right kind of institutional support.  They're not asking for charity, charity is no solution to poverty(https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2006/yunus/interview/)." He advocated for bringing opportunities to people, so that they change their own lives.  

I think a lot about strategy, how businesses and activities can be designed to create opportunities.  Where have we made assumptions about people that, if examined, may open up new opportunities to do things differently?
