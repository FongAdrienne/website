            <h2>Run and Debug</h2>
            <p><em>What I Learned in Building this Website</em></p>
            <p>I fired Squarespace.  After paying for a (discounted) annual subscription with the intention of using their beautifully designed templates, I chose to build the website myself.  There can be many benefits to paying for a website building service, including faster launch time, professional looking templates, and some customer support.  But taking the harder road and accepting that it will take longer to launch (8 months in the making, after work and weekends), meant what I got out of this project was far greater than a website.  There are always trade-offs. </p> 
            <p>Programming is also different from many other professions: you get instant feedback about whether your effort works.  I wrote one line of HTML and then hit ‘Run and Debug’.  Another line of HTML, then ‘Run and Debug’.  It was incredibly gratifying to see the direct link between my input to the desired output.  And when it works, you feel the momentum building and it feeds your desire to keep going.</p>
            <p>When it doesn’t work, another lesson in learning. Enter problem solving!  I ran into many roadblocks and hurdles along the way. I typed in code and didn’t see any change at all when I hit Run and Debug.  The table aligned to the left instead of centered.  Or the photo extended beyond the screen. I researched potential solutions with the resources I have - ChatGPT, Youtube, the Internet, a textbook I borrowed from the library.  When that didn’t work, I relied on another mode of thinking: the diffuse mode.  Give your brain a break, let it drift and it may piece together a solution for you.  I ran loops around my high school track, I washed dishes, I chopped carrots and celery for soup.  There were many times where letting go of focus helped me find a solution, including attacking the problem in a different way.

            <p>My website is far from perfect. But what I got out of it was more than a website, it was a welcome reminder of the joys of learning and trying new things.</p>
